# PatOS
Just a little project I started making an OS from scratch...
Might be fun to get people involved and see if we can get a kernel working ect...
As most of you know most OS systems still have a lot of backlog to be backwards compatible.
Just thought I would post this and see if there is any interest.
I will be concentrating on a kernel next.
I included a simple bootloader that seems to work on the master boot record.
